###  **:red[WSJ's Crypto-Terrorism Claims Under Scrutiny After On-Chain Analysis]**

The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) recently published a series of articles and an [op-ed by Senator Elizabeth Warren](https://www.wsj.com/articles/cryptocurrency-feeds-hamass-terrorism-e0db54f5), alleging that Hamas and other militant groups have raised over $130 million in cryptocurrency since 2021 to fund their attacks on Israel. The WSJ cited data from [Elliptic](https://www.elliptic.co/blog/analysis/israel-orders-seizure-of-crypto-wallets-worth-94-million-linked-to-palestinian-islamic-jihad), a blockchain analytics firm, and [BitOK](https://twitter.com/BitOK_org/status/1717245964061127042) as the main sources of its reporting. However, a closer examination of the on-chain data by independent researchers has cast doubt on the accuracy and validity of the WSJ's claims.

Sam found that Elliptic's methodology was flawed and resulted in significant overestimation of the amounts and volumes of crypto transactions linked to Hamas and its affiliates. For example, Elliptic claimed that the wallets associated with Hamas received 93 million USD in crypto between August 2021 and June 2023, but Sam's analysis showed that the actual amount was about $83 million, excluding transfers among the same wallets.

Sam found that BitOK's data was more accurate than Elliptic's, but still had some minor discrepancies. For instance, Sam's analysis showed that the total amount transferred into the wallets ASO 15/22 was 33.6 million USD, slightly lower than BitOK's figure.

The donations include proceeds from the sale of one of the most expensive non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in history. The NFT was created by Beeple, a digital artist who sold his artwork "Everydays: The First 5000 Days" for 69 million USD in March 2022. Beeple donated $5 million worth of Ether from his sale to Ukraine. The Ukraine government and organizations have also received donations in Bitcoin, Polkadot, Cardano and other cryptocurrencies. These donations show how crypto can be used to support democracy and freedom.

Amidst all this saga, I think it is important to highlight the positive impact that crypto can have on the world, especially in times of crisis and conflict. Crypto can enable people to donate and receive funds in a fast, secure, and transparent way, without intermediaries or censorship. Crypto can also empower communities and individuals to create and participate in innovative solutions for social and environmental problems. Crypto can also foster creativity and expression through digital art and culture.

Some of the projects mentioned in a post by [dailycoin](https://dailycoin.com/top-10-crypto-projects-dedicated-to-socio-humanitarian-causes/) about the top 10 crypto projects dedicated to socio humanitarian causes are using crypto to help people in need, such as UkraineDAO, Habitat for Humanity, and Built With Bitcoin Foundation. These projects are providing humanitarian aid, relief, and development to countries and regions that are facing war, poverty, and disaster. They are accepting donations in various cryptocurrencies and using them to fund their missions and activities.

Some of the projects mentioned are using crypto to advance scientific research and innovation, such as VitaDAO, Molecule, and Klima DAO. These projects are creating decentralized platforms and communities that enable collaborative funding and governance of life science and climate change projects. They are using tokens and smart contracts to incentivize and reward contributors and stakeholders.

Some of the projects mentioned are using crypto to create social impact NFTs, such as Impact, ARTXV, and Blockchain for Humanity. These projects are using NFTs as a medium to raise awareness and funds for various causes, such as education, health, diversity, inclusion, and sustainability. They are creating and selling digital artworks that represent their values and vision.

st.markdown("""
Moreover, crypto transactions are more transparent and traceable than other forms of money transfers. Blockchain technology allows anyone to access and analyze the public ledger of transactions on various networks. This makes it easier to identify and track the sources and destinations of funds. On the other hand, traditional financial systems are often opaque and complex, making it harder to follow the money trail. Terrorist organizations have been funding their illegal activities for years with or without crypto. Crypto is not the root cause of terrorism; it is just a tool that can be used for good or evil.

The WSJ's crypto-terrorism claims have been challenged by on-chain analysis, which revealed that the amounts and volumes of crypto transactions linked to Hamas and its affiliates were much lower than reported. The WSJ and Senator Warren should correct their errors and apologize for spreading misinformation that could harm the crypto industry and its users. Crypto is not a threat; it is an opportunity for innovation and social good.
